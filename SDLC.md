# Architechture
-- The architecture of a system describes its major components, their relationships (structures), and how they interact with each other.Software architecture and design includes several contributory factors such as Business strategy, quality attributes, human dynamics, design, and IT environment. 

# Software Architecture
-- nonfunctional decisions are cast and separated by the functional requirements. Architecture serves as a blueprint for a system. It provides an abstraction to manage the system complexity and establish a communication and coordination mechanism among components

# Software Design
-- In Design, functional requirements are accomplished. Software design provides a design plan that describes the elements of a system, how they fit, and work together to fulfill the requirement of the system.
